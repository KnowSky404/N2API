# N2API Deployment

The default deployment target is Docker Compose on a small VPS.

## Start Locally

From the repository root:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose -f deploy/compose.yaml --env-file .env up --build
```

The default app URL is `http://localhost:3000`.

## Provider Accounts

Start the stack, log in as admin, and use Provider accounts to connect one or more Codex OAuth accounts or API-key upstream accounts. Provider accounts are gateway exits. N2API supports Codex OAuth accounts and API-key upstream accounts. Both account types share enabled state, priority, health status, and per-account model lists.

The default OAuth flow uses the Codex-compatible OpenAI OAuth client with PKCE, so the OAuth client id, client secret, auth URL, and token URL can usually stay blank in `.env`.
Keep the default `OPENAI_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URL=http://localhost:1455/auth/callback` unless you are using your own registered OpenAI OAuth client. The built-in Codex-compatible client expects that local callback URI; after OpenAI redirects there, copy the browser URL back into N2API's callback field.

- Use the account row to set a display name, priority, and load factor. OAuth account creation also lets you choose whether the account should be enabled after login.
- Select rows on the Provider accounts page to bulk enable or disable provider accounts. Use **Enable selected** or **Disable selected** to change scheduling eligibility for the selected exits, and **Clear selection** to discard the selection without changing accounts.
- Set **Bulk priority** or **Bulk load factor**, then use **Apply scheduling** to update selected provider accounts together; bulk priority and bulk load factor use the same validation as each account row.
- Configure supported models on each connected account. These per-account model rows describe account capability for gateway routing.
- Use API Keys to control which configured models are exposed to clients and which model is used as the default when a POST request omits `model`. Global routable model settings do not make an account eligible for a model it has not configured.
- Client API keys default to all routable models. For narrower access, set a key to selected models on the API Keys page. A selected model must still have at least one enabled healthy provider account before the gateway can route requests to it.
- Use **Refresh** to force a token refresh for one account and clear stale transient state after a successful refresh.
- Use **Reauthorize** on an existing row to bind a fresh OAuth login back to that account instead of creating a second row.
- API upstream credentials can be updated from the account row. Rotating the encrypted API key or base URL clears local failure status so the account can be scheduled again with the new upstream settings.
- Use **Test account** before sending client traffic through an account. The action probes one provider account with its current OAuth token or API upstream key, clears local failure status on success, and records upstream failure status for 401/403/429/5xx probe responses. The account row keeps the last test status, last test time, and last test error so manual checks remain visible after refresh. Each probe also writes provider account test history, available from the admin API at `GET /api/admin/provider-accounts/{id}/test-results`.
- Use **Test selected** to probe selected provider accounts without probing the whole account pool. It updates the same last-test fields, health fields, and test history as **Test account**.
- Provider account auto tests are disabled by default. `N2API_PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_AUTO_TEST_ENABLED` and `N2API_PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_AUTO_TEST_INTERVAL_SECONDS` are startup defaults for Gateway Settings; after sign-in, use the Gateway Settings form to save the runtime auto-test setting. Enable it to run **Test all accounts** automatically in the backend, and use an interval of `300` seconds or higher for routine checks. Automatic tests update the same last test status, last test time, last test error, test history, and local account health fields shown in Provider accounts and Routing diagnostics.
- Use **Pause scheduling** when a healthy account should stop receiving traffic for a short window. Set **Pause duration seconds** on the Provider accounts page before clicking the action; it temporarily opens the account circuit for that window without disabling or deleting the account. Paused and rate-limited rows show the remaining scheduling block in the status column. Use **Reset local status** to clear the pause early.
- Disabled accounts are kept in PostgreSQL but are not selected for gateway traffic.
- Connected accounts with no configured models are kept in PostgreSQL and can be edited later, but they do not receive model-routed POST traffic.
- During migration, an install with a single connected provider account and no account-specific models backfills that account from the global allowed model list. Installs with multiple provider accounts keep models manual so routing does not assume false account capability.
- Lower priority numbers are selected before higher priority numbers.
- Within the same priority and health class, a higher load factor is considered before a lower load factor. Keep weak or quota-sensitive accounts at load factor `1`; raise stronger accounts when they should carry more traffic.
- Rate-limited, circuit-open, expired, and disabled accounts are skipped during gateway account selection.
- Upstream 429 responses mark the account as rate-limited, 401/403 mark it expired, and 5xx responses open a short circuit window before traffic tries another account.
- `/v1/models` returns the aggregate exposed models for the authenticated API key. All-model keys see the routable list after applying the global allowed-model list; selected-model keys see the intersection of their selected models and currently routable models.
- Routing diagnostics can preview scheduler fallback without sending traffic. In Selection preview, set **Excluded account IDs** to a comma-separated list such as `7, 8` to simulate those provider accounts being unavailable; excluded accounts remain visible as blocked candidates with the reason `account excluded`.
- If one enabled account cannot refresh a token or fails before streaming starts, N2API tries another eligible account that supports the same requested model.
- Once upstream streaming has started, N2API preserves that stream and does not retry against another account.
- OAuth access tokens, refresh tokens, id tokens, and short-lived PKCE verifier records are encrypted before being stored. Browser/request fingerprints are stored only as hashes.

## Gateway Runtime Limits

The deployment template includes optional in-process gateway guards:

- `N2API_GATEWAY_MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS` limits total active gateway requests.
- `N2API_GATEWAY_MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS_PER_ACCOUNT` limits active requests per provider account.
- `N2API_GATEWAY_MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS_PER_KEY` limits active requests per client API key.
- `N2API_GATEWAY_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE_PER_KEY` limits accepted requests per client API key per fixed minute.
- `N2API_GATEWAY_TOKENS_PER_MINUTE_PER_KEY` limits observed request tokens per client API key per fixed minute.

Set any gateway default value to `0` to disable that guard. These limits are process-local; keep them conservative on a single-node VPS and add shared infrastructure later if you need multi-instance coordination. The API Keys page shows the values loaded by the running service. Per-key values set to `0` inherit the matching gateway default and do not disable that guard for only one key. Local per-key request/token 429 responses include `Retry-After`; per-account concurrency skips busy accounts when another eligible account is available and returns 429 only when no eligible account can accept the request.

API upstream accounts require HTTPS by default so upstream API keys are not sent over plaintext HTTP. Set `N2API_ALLOW_HTTP_API_UPSTREAMS=true` only for trusted local or private HTTP upstreams that you control.

For sticky session routing, clients can send `session_id` in the POST body. If a client needs a header instead, prefer `X-N2API-Session-ID` through reverse proxies; `session_id` remains supported but contains an underscore and may be dropped by default proxy settings. If N2API is behind Nginx and clients send the `session_id` header, set `underscores_in_headers on;` in the relevant `http` or `server` block. A body `session_id` overrides either header.

Before upgrading an existing deployment, back up PostgreSQL because the upgrade adds unified provider account tables and client API key model-policy metadata.

## Required Services

- `n2api`: Go application service.
- `postgres`: PostgreSQL database with a persistent Docker volume.

Redis is intentionally not required for V1. Add it later only if distributed rate limiting, queueing, or multi-instance locking becomes necessary.
