# N2API Deployment

The default deployment target is Docker Compose on a small VPS.

## Start Locally

From the repository root:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose -f deploy/compose.yaml --env-file .env up --build
```

The default app URL is `http://localhost:3000`.

## Provider Accounts

Start the stack, log in as admin, and use Provider accounts to connect one or more Codex OAuth accounts or API-key upstream accounts. Provider accounts are gateway exits. N2API supports Codex OAuth accounts and API-key upstream accounts. Both account types share enabled state, priority, health status, and per-account model lists.

The default OAuth flow uses the Codex-compatible OpenAI OAuth client with PKCE, so the OAuth client id, client secret, auth URL, and token URL can usually stay blank in `.env`.
Keep the default `OPENAI_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URL=http://localhost:1455/auth/callback` unless you are using your own registered OpenAI OAuth client. The built-in Codex-compatible client expects that local callback URI; after OpenAI redirects there, copy the browser URL back into N2API's callback field.

- Use the account form to set a display name, priority, and whether the account should be enabled after OAuth login.
- Configure supported models on each connected account. These per-account model rows describe account capability for gateway routing.
- Use API Keys to control which configured models are exposed to clients and which model is used as the default when a POST request omits `model`. Global routable model settings do not make an account eligible for a model it has not configured.
- Client API keys default to all routable models. For narrower access, set a key to selected models on the API Keys page. A selected model must still have at least one enabled healthy provider account before the gateway can route requests to it.
- Use **Refresh** to force a token refresh for one account and clear stale transient state after a successful refresh.
- Use **Reauthorize** on an existing row to bind a fresh OAuth login back to that account instead of creating a second row.
- Disabled accounts are kept in PostgreSQL but are not selected for gateway traffic.
- Connected accounts with no configured models are kept in PostgreSQL and can be edited later, but they do not receive model-routed POST traffic.
- Lower priority numbers are selected before higher priority numbers.
- Rate-limited, circuit-open, expired, and disabled accounts are skipped during gateway account selection.
- Upstream 429 responses mark the account as rate-limited, 401/403 mark it expired, and 5xx responses open a short circuit window before traffic tries another account.
- `/v1/models` returns the aggregate exposed models across connected accounts after applying the global allowed-model list.
- If one enabled account cannot refresh a token or fails before streaming starts, N2API tries another eligible account that supports the same requested model.
- Once upstream streaming has started, N2API preserves that stream and does not retry against another account.
- OAuth access tokens, refresh tokens, id tokens, and short-lived PKCE verifier records are encrypted before being stored. Browser/request fingerprints are stored only as hashes.

Before upgrading an existing deployment, back up PostgreSQL because the upgrade adds unified provider account tables and client API key model-policy metadata.

## Required Services

- `n2api`: Go application service.
- `postgres`: PostgreSQL database with a persistent Docker volume.

Redis is intentionally not required for V1. Add it later only if distributed rate limiting, queueing, or multi-instance locking becomes necessary.
